// Error messages

/*
 - Error message has to be clear - user should know what HE DID WRONG and how he can fix that (but don't blame him)
 - Short and meaningful, Avoid using redundant words
 - Do not confuse user with termins - little stupid humans afraid of them
 - Positive clue
    ‚úÖ DO smth to get result
    ‚ùå YOU DID IT WRONG
 
 A good error message has three parts: problem identification, cause details if helpful, and a solution if possible.
 
 If text is long, use disclosure
